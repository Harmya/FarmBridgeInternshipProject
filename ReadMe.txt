-Project for Farmbridge Social Support Foundation-

Background: Prediction of the climate till end-century so as to deploy adequate agricultural methods to help the farmers with their yield.
We organize decades worth of climate data and use it to forecast future climate conditions.

This project:
- Downloads and converts the GRID data into a readble csv file 
- Organises the daily data into seasonal categories native to india. 
- Parameters that are being organised:
      - Maximum Temperature 
      - Minimum Temperature
      - Precipitation 
- Using different parameters to measure the effect of each variable on the climate 

We use this organized data to make predictions about the weather using various climate models licensed by various instituitions.
For intellectual property reasons, I cannot list them here.

How to run:
-the variables that need to be given an input highlighted and have "#input" next to them

- Steps to extract and organise all data:
     -run the 'main.py" file 
     -run "RainyCases.py" file 
We need to run RainyCases.py separately because this script relies on organized rain data.

(the Forecast files (that start with "Fore") are used to sort and organise from various climate models licensed by various instituitions)
